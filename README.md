This repo hosts several tools built while learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The tools are hosted with GitHub Pages and can be accessed here: https://josephkmaina.github.io/tools.

Enjoy playing with the tools :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Resistance Calculator

This tool is used to determine the resistance of [resistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor) by calculating from the color code.

The calculator is simple to use. You should try it (even if you are not into analogue electronics).

## Savings Calculator

This tool will help you know how much money you need to deposit regularly in order to save a known amount over a period of time.

## Piggy

Lastly, I will be building this full-stack app for [Chamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_(investment)). This is an Information Management System specifically for Chamas that are so common in Kenya.

## Getting Started

If you want to try out these tools in your development environment, then here we go:

1. Fork this repo and clone into your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephkmaina/josephkmaina.github.io.git your-dir
```

2. `cd` to the `your-dir` directory

3. Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

4. Happy coding!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
